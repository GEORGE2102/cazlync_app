## 📋 Field-by-Field Help Content

### Brand
```
The brand is the company that made the car.

Common brands:
• Toyota
• Honda
• Nissan
• BMW
• Mercedes-Benz
• Mazda
• Volkswagen

Look for the logo on the front of the car 
or check the registration documents.
```

### Model
```
The model is the specific name of the car.

Examples:
• Toyota Corolla
• Honda Civic
• BMW X5
• Nissan Patrol

You can find this on:
• The back of the car
• Registration documents
• Owner's manual
```

### Year
```
The year the car was made.

Where to find it:
• Registration documents
• Vehicle logbook
• Door frame sticker
• VIN plate

If unsure, check your car registration 
papers - it's always listed there.
```

### Mileage
```
Mileage is the total distance the car 
has traveled.

Where to find it:
• Look at the odometer (the number display 
  on your dashboard)
• It shows the total kilometers

Example:
• If it shows 45,234 km, enter: 45234
• If it shows 120,567 km, enter: 120567

Lower mileage usually means:
• Less wear and tear
• Higher value
• Better condition
```

### Price
```
Tips for setting a good price:

1. Check similar cars on CazLync
2. Consider the car's:
   • Age (older = lower price)
   • Mileage (higher km = lower price)
   • Condition (better = higher price)
   • Brand popularity

3. Be realistic - overpriced cars don't sell
4. You can negotiate with buyers

Not sure? Select "Contact for a price" below.
```

### Body Type
```
Body type is the shape of your car:

🚙 Sedan: 4 doors, separate trunk 
   (e.g., Corolla, Camry)

🚗 Hatchback: 2-4 doors, rear door opens up 
   (e.g., Vitz, Fit)

🚙 SUV: Tall, spacious, good for rough roads 
   (e.g., Prado, RAV4)

🛻 Pickup: Open cargo bed at back 
   (e.g., Hilux, Ranger)

🚗 Coupe: 2 doors, sporty 
   (e.g., sports cars)

🚐 Van: Large, for passengers/cargo 
   (e.g., Hiace, Caravan)

🚙 Wagon: Like sedan but with more cargo space

Not sure? Choose "Other"
```

### Condition
```
Choose the condition that best describes 
your car:

✨ Brand New:
• Never been used
• 0 km on odometer
• Still has factory warranty
• Just bought from dealer

🚗 Used:
• Has been driven before
• Any mileage above 0
• Previously owned
• Most cars fall here

Be honest about the condition - buyers 
will inspect the car!
```

### Transmission
```
Transmission is how the car changes gears:

🔧 Manual:
• You shift gears yourself
• Has a clutch pedal (3 pedals total)
• Gear stick you move by hand
• More common in Zambia

⚙️ Automatic:
• Car shifts gears automatically
• No clutch pedal (2 pedals only)
• Just press gas and brake
• Easier to drive

How to check:
• Count the pedals
• 3 pedals = Manual
• 2 pedals = Automatic

Or check the gear stick:
• Numbers (1,2,3,4,5) = Manual
• Letters (P,R,N,D) = Automatic
```

### Fuel Type
```
What your car runs on:

⛽ Petrol (Gasoline):
• Most common in Zambia
• Usually cheaper than diesel
• Green pump at gas station

🚛 Diesel:
• Common in trucks and SUVs
• Better fuel economy
• Black pump at gas station

🔋 Electric:
• Runs on battery only
• No fuel needed
• Very rare in Zambia

🔋⛽ Hybrid:
• Uses both petrol and electric
• Better fuel economy
• Examples: Prius, Aqua

How to check:
• Look at fuel cap label
• Check registration papers
• Ask at gas station which pump you use
```

### Location
```
Where is the car located?

Just enter the city or town:
• Lusaka
• Kitwe
• Ndola
• Livingstone
• Kabwe
• Chingola
• Mufulira
• Solwezi

Buyers will contact you for the exact address.
```
